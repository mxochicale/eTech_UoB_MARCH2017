Emerging Technologies (eTech) Competition
========================

The Emerging Technologies Competition (eTech) is a new initiative that aims to
attract innovative ideas and incentivize the innovative use of emerging
technologies by undergraduate and postgraduate students at the
University of Birmingham.

The Emerging Technology Competition (ETech) is an annual event organised by the 
IT Innovation Centre to promote innovative uses of emerging technology. The ETech 
Competition is free to enter and open to ALL current undergraduate and postgraduate 
students at the university, technical or non-technical. You can enter as an individual 
or as a team. To enter you need to come up with an innovative idea to use an emerging 
technology of your choice. You will need to submit a design or a working prototype 
to show how the technology will work. This year we propose some areas of interest 
to focus your ideas on, although you can also choose something else:

- Teaching and Learning
- Life at the University
- Health and Wellbeing
- Energy and Environment

Examples of emerging technologies include: drones, cybersecurity, 3D printing, 
virtual reality, augmented reality, robot,  blockchain, gesture controlled technologies, 
mobile applications and any other emerging technology of your choice.
