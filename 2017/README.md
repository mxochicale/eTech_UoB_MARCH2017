Emerging Technologies (eTech) Competition
========================

The Emerging Technologies Competition (eTech) is a new initiative that aims to
attract innovative ideas and incentivize the innovative use of emerging
technologies by undergraduate and postgraduate students at the
University of Birmingham.



### OBSERVATIONS
It is a great opportunity for students from different areas to peach
your projects to real people from industry. My observation from this event is
that the winners' projects were more related
to the improvement of student life than any other of the categories for
"Health and Wellbeing" and "Energy and the Environment".
For instance, Wherechair that can be used in the
library or coffee shops to find a free place, or the Virtual Learning Assistant
which takes advantages of speech recognitions to create personalised content
for the student.

### FEEDBACK FOR MY PROJECT
I received good questions regarding possible scenceraios of applications of the robot.
One of the jugdes pointed that it would be good to know the market (e.g. Elderly Care Homes)
that can be potential buyers of the ROCY's project. If one want to raise interest,
I learnt that it is very important to find the correct audience to peach your project.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
Generally speaking I believe that it was a well organised event.
I can only suggest that the judging panel should also be from each of the
following areas of "Health and Wellbeing" and "Energy and the Environment"
to have a well balanced competition. It might also help that for future events
you share the videos and presentations of previous winners as well as the
criteria for judges to have a better understanding of the competition.
